# FCC Responsive Web Design Project 1 - Build a Tribute Page 

This is Project Number 1 for FCC (Free Code Camp) which asked us to build a simple Tribute Page using HTML5 and CSS3 given specific stories. Project 1 of 5 needed to be completed in order to get the Responsive Web Design Certificate. 

### User Stories
* **User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
* **User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* **User Story #3:** I should see a divelement with a corresponding id="img-div".
User Story #4: Within the img-divelement, I should see an imgelement with a corresponding id="image".
* **User Story #5:** Within the img-divelement, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption"that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
* **User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* **User Story #7:** I should see an aelement with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of targetand set it to _blankin order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
* **User Story #8:** The imgelement should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* **User Story #9:** The imgelement should be centered within its parent element.
